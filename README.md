# CNPJ Alfanum√©rico

Java code for CNPJ Alphanumeric validation

Some design choices that might not be so clear:

Why not use regex?
Regex and Patterns in Java have a very low performance.
Some methods in String class use a Pattern instances.
These methods are not suitable for repeated use in performance-critical situations.
The problem is that it internally creates a Pattern instance for the regular expression and uses it only once, after which it becomes eligible for garbage collection.
Creating a Pattern instance is expensive because it requires compiling the regular expression into a finite state machine.

Why not use for-loops to compute the validation digits?
It is better to avoid mutation and for-loops increase the complexity of an algorithm.
The logic is not dynamic and is straight forward.

Why not use Streams?
This algorythm uses arrays of primitive types (char and int) and Streams for chars need a wrapper class for each item.
I tried to avoid unecessary object creation.
Streams (and a Functional Style of programming) are great, but there are some classes and methods that are only available in newer versions of Java.
You can use this code even in Java 1.5 (legacy systems).
