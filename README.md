# CNPJ Alfanum√©rico

Java code for CNPJ Alphanumeric validation

Some design choices that might not be so clear:

Why don't use regex?
Regexes have low performance in Java.

Why don't use for loops to compute the validation digits?
It is better to avoid mutation and for-loops increase the complexity of an algorithm.
The logic is not dynamic and is straight forward.
